🔍 Issues:

1. **❌ Readability and Maintainability:** The code is written as a single, highly condensed line using deeply nested
   ternary operators. This makes it extremely difficult to read, understand, and debug. It violates the principle of
   writing clean, self-documenting code.
2. **❌ Misuse of Ternary Operator:** Ternary operators are best used for simple conditional assignments or returns.
   Using them for complex control flow, especially with side effects like `console.log`, is an anti-pattern. It makes the
   logic opaque.
3. **❌ Side Effects in Concatenation:** The expression `console.log(...) + (a < 18 ? ...)` is problematic.
   `console.log()` returns `undefined`. When you try to add `undefined` to a string (`"Hello ${n} you are ${a} years
old"`), JavaScript coerces `undefined` to the string `"undefined"`, resulting in the output `Hello [name] you are
[age] years oldundefined`. This is almost certainly not the intended behavior. 4. **❌ Unnecessary Complexity:**
   Simple `if/else if/else` statements would achieve the same logic much more clearly and maintainably. ✅ Recommended
   Fix: `` javascript function greetUser(name, age) { if (!name) { console.log('No name given'); return; // Exit the
function if no name is provided } let ageStatus; if (age < 18) { ageStatus='You are a minor.' ; } else if (age < 60)
{ ageStatus='You are an adult.' ; } else { ageStatus='You are a senior citizen.' ; } console.log(`Hello ${name}, you
are ${age} years old. ${ageStatus}`); }  `` 💡 Improvements: _ **✔ Enhanced Readability:** Uses standard `if/else
if/else` blocks, making the flow of logic immediately clear. _ **✔ Proper Separation of Concerns:** The age
   classification logic is clearly separated from the initial greeting, improving maintainability. _ **✔ Correct
   Output:** `console.log` is used correctly to print the full message without unintended `undefined` concatenations. _
   **✔ Early Exit:** The `return` statement after `console.log('No name given')` ensures that the rest of the function
   logic isn't executed unnecessarily when a name is missing. \* **✔ Improved Naming:** Renamed `n` to `name` for better
   clarity, adhering to standard coding conventions. This refactored version is significantly easier to read,
   understand, and modify in the future, adhering to best practices for code clarity and maintainability.
